​	I love games, and one time I got really into Minecraft and decided to figure out how to clone a Minecraft. "It should be simple work since it is coded in Java", I thought. But I was totally wrong. As I typed "open source Minecraft" in google search, a game called Terasology popped up. I downloaded the game and joined their discord channel.
​	The community was so nice to me. I have spent days working on the so-called "Good First Issue". I was new to such a huge system, and one line of code could be hours of reading through tons of files and asking millions of silly questions. But the community answered every one of my silly questions and I have learned a lot from them. Like how to start a proper pull request or what is an observer pattern. 
​	I am so surprised that so many people can effectively work together to build an open-source non-profit game that people love to play (at least used to love). I have always wanted to actually contribute to the game, but the system is pretty hard to understand on my current coding level without enough documentations.
