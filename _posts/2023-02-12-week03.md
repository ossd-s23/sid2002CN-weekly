## Add-on project

#### Issues:

Despite my lack of experience with plain Javascript and html, I was determined to learn how to build the add-on with React. My team agreed to use React, and I was able to find comprehensive documentation on how to create a Firefox extension using React. However, I was faced with a new challenge. While I had a good understanding of how to use React, I was unaware of how a Firefox add-on extension interacted with server-related issues. This was a significant roadblock in my progress, and I knew that I needed to find a solution to overcome this challenge.

#### Contributions:

I was initially excited about the prospect of storing the background image that the user uploaded as a temporary state in the project. I thought it would be a straightforward task of simply storing the relative image path URL chosen by the user as a state. However, upon implementation, I encountered a roadblock when I realized that the browser would not expose the actual file path to the application and instead modified all file paths to "./fakepath/filename." This news left me feeling desperate and ready to give up on the project. But, after pouring through numerous Stack Overflow posts, I found a solution that allowed me to get the actual file path. The excitement of finally being able to make progress on the project was overwhelming, and I was eager to implement the solution. My determination paid off and the workaround proved successful. It was a small victory, but it gave me a sense of accomplishment.
