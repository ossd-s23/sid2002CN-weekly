## Summary about Add-on project

#### Discussion with Mek:

Before my conversation with Mek, I had a biased understanding of online libraries. I thought they were just websites that hosted free, copyright-infringing copies of books. However, Mek introduced me to openlibrary.org, which operates under a different model.

Open Library is a digital lending library, and when you borrow a book from it, you are actually borrowing a physical copy of the book. This is made possible by partnerships with various libraries around the world, which contribute their physical books to Open Library's collection.

It is a surprise to me that the Open Library has a vast collection of over 2 million digital books, including rare and out-of-print titles. Its digital collection is supplemented by a growing collection of audiobooks, videos, and other media.

What's really fascinating about Open Library is the way it combines the traditional model of a physical library with the convenience and accessibility of an online platform. The storage racks where the physical books are kept are located in actual libraries around the world, and the books are retrieved and shipped to borrowers on request.

Overall, I was impressed by the innovative approach that Open Library takes to digital lending. It combines the best of both worlds, allowing readers to access a vast digital collection while preserving the physical book borrowing experience. I think Open Library represents a glimpse into the future of libraries.

#### Contributions:

Lately, I've been contributing a bit to OpenStreetMap and Wikipedia by adding some of my favorite restaurants, groceries, and video games. Last week, I also attempted to contribute to the Open Library, but I found it challenging to navigate due to its unique organizational structure, even with the assistance of newcomer guides and starting points. I've also been working on contributing to Valhalla-app, a react-based open street map visualizer. Though I've been able to find a few good first issues to work on, I'm still honing my skills with the platform with my newly learned language from the Udemy course. While I haven't made any notable contributions yet, I'm committed to making a meaningful contribution next week.
