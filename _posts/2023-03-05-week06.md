## **Open source project**

#### Thoughts:

As a beginner, I find it difficult to identify the right open-source project that suits my needs. There are numerous criteria to consider, such as finding a community that is welcoming to newcomers, prompt replies from maintainers, and programming languages that I am familiar with. Despite thoroughly searching project evaluation repositories, I have yet to find a project that perfectly aligns with my requirements. Even after dedicating an hour to searching for an open-source project, I was still unable to find one that met my expectations. Nonetheless, I have shortlisted Terasology and Teamates, as they appear to be more beginner-friendly than complex platforms like Hadoop, Open Library, ...

There's something incredibly fulfilling about seeing the seeable results of my work, no matter the size or scope of the changes I make. Whether it's a major improve of a system or a minor fix to a small bug, the feeling of satisfaction that comes from knowing that I've contributed to something meaningful is hard to beat. I love taking on complex challenges (only those that can be solved) that require problem-solving skills, and the sense of accomplishment that comes from successfully solving them is truly gratifying.

#### Challenges:

As we'll be working in a team, I anticipate that the biggest challenge will be collaborating with my teammates. In the past, I've found it difficult to work on coding projects in a group setting. Often, there are conflicting expectations about the level of effort each person should contribute, and it can be challenging to build upon someone else's code. This has made me hesitant to work on coding projects in a team environment.

The key to overcoming these challenges is to have teammates who are open to learning and effective communication. When everyone is committed to learning from each other and communicating effectively, it becomes easier to work collaboratively towards a shared goal. And the shared explicit goal is also a key part which needs to be established at the first.
