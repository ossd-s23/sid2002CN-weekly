## **Open source project**

#### Thoughts:

Our group chose MindsDB as our open source project, and I was excited about the opportunity to work on a real-world project and contribute to the open-source community. However, I must admit that I was a bit worried since I don't have a deep understanding of Python and SQL, which are crucial tools for working on the project. Fortunately, my teammates seem to be good at these tools.

Regarding my hopes for the group work, I hope to make a meaningful contribution to the project and the open-source community. I also hope to learn more about Python and SQL and gain more experience in working on real-world projects. I believe that the group work will help me develop essential skills such as teamwork and communication.

On the other hand, I also have some worries regarding the group work. I am worried that I may not be able to contribute as much as my teammates due to my limited knowledge of Python and SQL. I am also worried about meeting the project deadlines given the amount of work from other courses.

In conclusion, group work can be a challenging but rewarding experience, and I am grateful for the opportunity to work on MindsDB with my teammates. Despite being sick for almost the entire first half of the semester, I will try to make some real significant contributions during the remaining time. I am also committed to learning more about Python and SQL and improving my skills.
