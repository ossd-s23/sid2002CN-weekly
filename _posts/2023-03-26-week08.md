## **Open source project**

#### Group Work:

Our group selected MindsDB as our open source project, and I initially thought that the installation would be straightforward. However, there were multiple pages for installation on their website, which made it overwhelming. Although they had sufficient instructions for regular users, their instructions for those willing to contribute to the project were limited to a single page. Installing it from source for Windows proved to be particularly challenging and took me about two hours to resolve all the issues.

One of the main issues was that the latest pip tool was required to install MindsDB, and it could only be installed with the latest version of Python. However, this created a conflict since Windows users needed to install MindsDB with a special virtual environment that used Python 3.8.0 while their outer environment still used the latest Python version. After hours of online research, I managed to solve the problem, and I was thrilled to see the application screen appear. I shared my solution with Scott, who also had difficulty installing it on Windows, during our next day's meeting.

To help others avoid the installation issues that I faced, I plan to contribute to the documentation of the installation page, particularly for Windows users.

#### Jim Hall's talk:

I had the pleasure of listening to Jim Hall's fascinating talk about the history of computer operating systems. He provided a comprehensive overview of the generations of Freedos and their evolution over the years. It was intriguing to see how technology has evolved and how far we have come in terms of operating systems.

One thing that particularly stood out to me during Jim's talk was how he started to use and program DOS from his interest in DOS games. He shared that his passion for DOS games sparked his curiosity about how computers work and how he could create his own programs.

I found this aspect of his journey quite interesting because it highlights the power of personal interests in driving learning and skill development. Often, we tend to separate different aspects of our lives and think of our hobbies and passions as separate from our professional aspirations. However, as Jim's experience demonstrates, these two aspects can be intertwined and can complement each other.

Another point that Jim emphasized was the importance of "cliched" computer science knowledge, such as understanding memory management, file systems, and command-line interfaces. While these topics may seem basic or even outdated to some, Jim stressed that they provide a strong foundation for understanding how computer systems work and are still relevant today.
