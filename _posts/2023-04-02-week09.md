## **Open source project**

#### Group Work:

With the assistance of the maintainers, we were finally able to overcome the installation hurdles of the software from source.

We discovered that the problem was related to the default language settings of Scott and Yuri's computers, which caused them to use a non-UTF 8 version. Thanks to the maintainers' expertise, we were able to pinpoint and resolve the issue quickly.

In addition to resolving the installation issues, we also made efforts to become more involved with the project's community. We attended the maintainers' monthly meetings where we gained insights into the project's latest features and upcoming hackathon. This helped us stay up-to-date on the project's progress and allowed us to connect with other developers and contributors.

We also delved into the details of Google Fit APIs and submitted an application for access to use them. Moving forward, our focus will be on further exploring how the handlers work, as this will be critical to our ongoing work on the project. We are excited about the progress we have made so far and willing to do more in the next week.
