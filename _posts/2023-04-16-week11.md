## **Open source project**

#### Chrispher Snider:
I am kind of shocked by the fact a software could directly impact a patient's life or death can be presented as a open source project. However, it is important to note that there are extensive procedures and safety measures in place to ensure that these programs are thoroughly tested and evaluated before being implemented and updated.

Then I am confused about why bother make it opensource if most people won't be able to contribute to it. Chrispher points out that by providing transparency, open source software allows individuals to examine the code and understand how it works, even if they are not experts in the field. This promotes a sense of trust and enables people to identify any issues or vulnerabilities, propose solutions, and ensure that the software is functioning as intended.

#### Group work:

So the first problem we're facing is with the Google authentication. It's a bit more complicated than average app, so we need to dig deep and figure out what their specific requirements are. We want to make sure our authentication process meets their standards and keeps things nice and secure since we have to contribute to a well organized and secured app.

The second issue is all about recognizing the data structure of mindsdb. We need to get familiar with the way it's set up so that we can actually connect our system with it. This might mean doing some extra analysis and decoding of the other handlers (comments are not that helpful here) to make sure everything lines up.
