## **Open source project**

#### open source within industry:
Thanks to this class, I now have a better understanding of how MindsDB works. Attending their monthly meetings helped me realize that MindsDB is a startup with a dedicated team of employees. Initially, I was skeptical about whether it could be classified as an open-source project. However, I now understand that it falls under the category of open core projects, where the core technology is open-source, but certain features and functionalities are reserved for paid subscribers.

MindsDB's open-source core provides users with many free machine learning (ML) tools, but they also offer subscription-based upgrades for more advanced ML models and better server capabilities. Overall, it's impressive how MindsDB has struck a balance between keeping its core technology open and accessible while generating revenue from their premium offerings.

#### Group work:

After several days of struggling, we were finally able to complete the Google authentication process. It took us a while to wrap our heads around how it worked, especially since Google only provides complete documentation for their Python API packages for Google Docs and Google Sheets. Unfortunately, we hit a roadblock with Google Fit since there was no readily available documentation we could find anywhere.

Thankfully, we stumbled upon an open-source project that integrated with the Google Fit API. We spent a few hours today poring over its codebase and finally gained a clear understanding of how it worked. With this newfound knowledge, we were able to successfully connect our integration to the Google Fit API. It's amazing how open-source projects can help solve problems and fill the gaps left by larger companies like Google.
