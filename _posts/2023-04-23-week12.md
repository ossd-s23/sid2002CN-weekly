## **Open source project**

#### open source within industry:
Thanks to this class, I now have a better understanding of how MindsDB works. Attending their monthly meetings helped me realize that MindsDB is a startup with a dedicated team of employees. Initially, I was skeptical about whether it could be classified as an open-source project. However, I now understand that it falls under the category of open core projects, where the core technology is open-source, but certain features and functionalities are reserved for paid subscribers.

MindsDB's open-source core provides users with many free machine learning (ML) tools, but they also offer subscription-based upgrades for more advanced ML models and better server capabilities. Overall, it's impressive how MindsDB has struck a balance between keeping its core technology open and accessible while generating revenue from their premium offerings.

#### Group work:

So the first problem we're facing is with the Google authentication. It's a bit more complicated than average app, so we need to dig deep and figure out what their specific requirements are. We want to make sure our authentication process meets their standards and keeps things nice and secure since we have to contribute to a well organized and secured app.

The second issue is all about recognizing the data structure of mindsdb. We need to get familiar with the way it's set up so that we can actually connect our system with it. This might mean doing some extra analysis and decoding of the other handlers (comments are not that helpful here) to make sure everything lines up.
