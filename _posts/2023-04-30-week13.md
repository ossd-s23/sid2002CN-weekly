## **Open source project**


#### Group work:

As we approach the end of the semester, we find ourselves exhausted from the multiple homework assignments and projects we have had to complete. This exhaustion makes it difficult for us to come together and work on our current project. The project itself is challenging because we are not familiar with Python - it's like being asked to solve calculus equations after only knowing how to solve simple algebra problems. Scott and I recently spent an hour trying to understand just one line of code from another Github repository. Despite the difficulty, these "decoding" activities have taught us a lot, and we are committed to doing our best to complete the project before our presentation.

Back to "decoding" now, hope we will make it working tonight.
